Returns a subset of the CUTEst problems using the classification file
`classf.json`. This file is export together with the package, so if you have an
old CUTEst installation, it can lead to inconsistencies.

- `min_var` and `max_var` set the number of variables in the problem;
- `min_con` and `max_con` set the number of constraints in the problem
(e.g., use `max_con=0` for unconstrained or `min_con=1` for constrained)
- `only_*` flags are self-explaining. Note that they appear in conflicting
pairs. Both can be false, but only one can be true.
- `objtype` is the classification of the objective function according to the
[MASTSIF classification file](https://www.cuter.rl.ac.uk/Problems/classification.shtml).
It can be a number, a symbol, a string, or an array of those.

    1, :none or "none" means there is no objective function;
    2, :constant or "constant" means the objective function is a constant;
    3, :linear or "linear" means the objective function is a linear functional;
    4, :quadratic or "quadratic" means the objective function is quadratic;
    5, :sum_of_squares or "sum_of_squares" means the objective function is a sum of squares
    6, :other or "other" means the objective function is none of the above.

- `contype` is the classification of the constraints according to the same
  MASTSIF classification file.

    1, :unc or "unc" means there are no constraints at all;
    2, :fixed_vars or "fixed_vars" means the only constraints are fixed variables;
    3, :bounds or "bounds" means the only constraints are bounded variables;
    4, :network or "network" means the constraints represent the adjacency matrix of a (linear) network;
    5, :linear or "linear" means the constraints are linear;
    6, :quadratic or "quadratic" means the constraints are quadratic;
    7, :other or "other" means the constraints are more general.

- `custom_filter` is a function to be applied to the problem data, which is a
  dict with the following fields:

    "objtype"           - String    one of the above objective function types
    "contype"           - String    one of the above constraint types
    "regular"           - Bool      whether the problem is regular or not
    "derivative_order"  - Int       order of the highest derivative available
    "origin"            - String    origin of the problem: "academic", "modelling" or "real"
    "has_interval_var"  - Bool      whether it has interval variables
    "variables"         - Dict with the following fields
      "can_choose"      - Bool      whether you can change the number of variables via parameters
      "number"          - Int       the number of variables (if `can_choose`, the default)
      "fixed"           - Int       the number of fixed variables
      "free"            - Int       the number of free variables
      "bounded_below"   - Int       the number of variables bounded only from below
      "bounded_above"   - Int       the number of variables bounded only from above
      "bounded_both"    - Int       the number of variables bounded from below and above
    "constraints"       - Dict with the following fields
      "can_choose"      - Bool      whether you can change the number of constraints via parameters
      "number"          - Int       the number of constraints (if `can_choose`, the default)
      "equality"        - Int       the number of equality constraints
      "ineq_below"      - Int       the number of inequalities of the form c(x) ≧ cl
      "ineq_above"      - Int       the number of inequalities of the form c(x) ≦ cu
      "ineq_both"       - Int       the number of inequalities of the form cl ≦ c(x) ≦ cu
      "linear"          - Int       the number of linear constraints
      "nonlinear"       - Int       the number of nonlinear constraints

For instance, if you'd like to choose only problems with fixed number of
  variables, you can pass

    custom_filter=x->x["variables"]["can_choose"]==false
